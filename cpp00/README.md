WELCOME TO THE CPP WORLD:

The aim of this module is to introduce you to C++ object-oriented programming.

In this repository, there are two exercises:
Module00 - Exercise 1: String Converter

The first exercise focuses on creating a simple program that takes one argument (a string) during the execution phase and converts all lowercase letters to uppercase while keeping the other characters unchanged. While working on this exercise, you will encounter some important C++ syntax, such as the use of the <iostream> library for input/output stream and the std namespace (e.g., std::cout, std::endl).
Module00 - Exercise 2: Crappy Phonebook

The second exercise is a bit more complicated. Its purpose is to create a program that behaves like a phonebook from the 80s (more details can be found in the PDF file provided). To complete this exercise, you will need to understand how to create a class, declare its attributes and member functions, and learn about concepts such as constructors, destructors, setter functions, and getter functions. Additionally, since you are using C++, you will need to utilize libraries such as <iomanip>, which stands for input/output manipulation. This library contains useful functions like std::right (used to right-align printed strings) and std::setw() (used to set the width to a specific number of characters). Overall, these exercises provide a solid foundation for understanding essential concepts and tools necessary for future modules.

Definitions:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes data and functions into objects. It emphasizes the concepts of encapsulation,
    inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which encapsulate data (attributes) and 
    behaviors (methods).

    Class Syntax:
    A class in C++ defines a blueprint for creating objects. It specifies the attributes and behaviors that objects of that class should have. 
    The general syntax for a class declaration is as follows:
    cpp

class ClassName {
    // Data members (attributes)
    // Member functions (methods)
};

Data members represent the state or characteristics of objects, while member functions define the operations or behaviors associated with the objects of the class.
